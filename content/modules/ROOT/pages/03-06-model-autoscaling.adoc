= Model Autoscaling
include::_attributes.adoc[]

. Let's see what happens when we send our model many requests at once.
. We will setup another notebook...
.. And use a library called Asyncio to let us send those requests.


- In your running workbench, `ignore the 03 folder`, navigate to the folder `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/04`.
- Look for (and open) the notebook called `03-06-model-autoscaling.ipynb`.
- Execute the cells of the notebook, and ensure you understand what is happening.
